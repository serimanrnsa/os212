1. [Markdown Crash Course](https://youtu.be/HUBNt18RFbo)<br>
    This video is the first thing that came to mind because it helped a lot in the making of this GitHub Page. It teaches the very basic of Markdown to help build a simple page like the one you're at right now. üòÑ
    
1. [All about Linux](https://www.javatpoint.com/linux-tutorial)<br>
    You can find basic introduction to Linux here. There are also a lot of information on Linux commands so you can use it as a cheat sheet when navigating the Linux command line.

1. [C Tutorial](https://www.learn-c.org/)<br>
    A nice site to learn C programming language.

1. [OSP4DISS](https://osp4diss.vlsm.org/)<br>
    If you're in OS212 course chances are you already know about this site. It is extremely useful for the weekly assignments. You just read and follow the instructions carefully and you're set for the week.

1. [A Pretty Good episode](https://youtu.be/E7w_v9J7iOc)<br>
    This is unrelated to OS (sorry) but you might find it interesting.

1. [Linux File System Explained üìÅ](https://youtu.be/HbgzrKJvDRw)<br>
    This video explains the file system in Linux. This is great especially for Windows users who are trying out Linux for the first time.

1. [Explaining File Systems: NTFS, exFAT, FAT32, ext4 & More üìÅ](https://youtu.be/_h30HBYxtws)<br>
    This video explains file systems across different OS and drives, their similarities, and their differences.
    
1. [Virtual Memory Explanation](https://youtu.be/2quKyPnUShQ)<br>
    I really like this explanation of week 4's topic: virtual memory.
    
1. [Use After Free Vulnerability](https://6point6.co.uk/insights/common-software-vulnerabilities-part-ii-explaining-the-use-after-free/)<br>
    In week 4, there was a few questions on the course forum and I looked here for the answers. It explains what UAF is and why it is a vulnerability that can be used for malicious reasons.

1. [Page Replacement Algorithm: Optimal](https://youtu.be/q2BpMvPhhrY)<br>
    This video is amazing. I was very confused as to how the optimal algorithm works when I was reading the textbook so I scoured through Youtube for additional explanation and I found this and now I'm not confused anymore. üòÑ

1. [OS Course Youtube Playlist](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLxCzCOWd7aiGz9donHRrE9I3Mwn6XdP8p)<br>
    This is playlist containing the last video on this list and it is a GODSENT. Most if not all of OS material is in there. It is partly in Hindi though I think, so consider yourself warned.
