1. [Markdown Crash Course](https://youtu.be/HUBNt18RFbo)<br>
    This video is the first thing that came to mind because it helped a lot in the making of this GitHub Page. It teaches the very basic of Markdown to help build a simple page like the one you're at right now. ðŸ˜„
    
1. [All about Linux](https://www.javatpoint.com/linux-tutorial)<br>
    You can find basic introduction to Linux here. There are also a lot of information on Linux commands so you can use it as a cheat sheet when navigating the Linux command line.

1. [C Tutorial](https://www.learn-c.org/)<br>
    A nice site to learn C programming language.

1. [OSP4DISS](https://osp4diss.vlsm.org/)<br>
    If you're in OS212 course chances are you already know about this site. It is extremely useful for the weekly assignments. You just read and follow the instructions carefully and you're set for the week.

1. [A Pretty Good episode](https://youtu.be/E7w_v9J7iOc)<br>
    This is unrelated to OS (sorry) but you might find it interesting.
